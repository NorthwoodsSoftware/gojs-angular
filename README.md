# Angular / GoJS - Basic OrgChart Editor

This project privides a basic example of using GoJS in an Angular app.

When running the sample, click on a Node. An Inspector window appears. Changing values in the Inspector will update the Nodes. This is done through a top down application struture, where the top level App Component passes data to the Diagram and Inspector Components.

## Installation

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
